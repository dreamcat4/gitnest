# GitNest: Submodules for the rest of us

GitNest is a small command-line tool managing cloned repositories within a main repository. In short, GitNest aims to be yet another submodules-a-like scheme, however vastly improved. The following pages are available here to help explain the ins-and-outs.

This gem is in early stages of development. A [modified version of braid](https://github.com/dreamcat4/braid) has been cobbled-together so far as proof-of-concept. Currently the braid prototype is supporting a basic sub-set of commands 'add' and 'update', including a few convenience switches such as -g, -p, and --branch. We are currently at 0.0.0 for the GitNest gem proper, with just the documentation in place.
